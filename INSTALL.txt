 -----------------------
  Installation of EnsDAM
 -----------------------

 You need a FORTRAN-90 compiler and the NetCDF library (with f90 support) installed.


 To compile the library and the examples :

 - create a 'make.macro' file corresponding to your compiler in the 'macro' directory.
   This is the Makefile configurable part, which specifies
   your compiler options and where to find the NetCDF library.

 - edit the Makefile to include this 'make.macro' file (first line below the title)

 - compile with "make" (gmake)

 - compile examples with "make examples" (gmake)

 - if everything goes well, the EnsDAM library 'libensdam.a'
   has been created in the 'lib' directory, the module files (*.mod)
   have been created in the 'include' directory' and the example
   exexutables (*.x) have been created in the 'examples' directory.

 To check the installation :

 - run the examples in the 'example' directory:
     1st: random_field_on_the_sphere.x
     2nd: low_pass_filter_on_the_sphere.x
     3rd: observation_regression_on_the_sphere.x
